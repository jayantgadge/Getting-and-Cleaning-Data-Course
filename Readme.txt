Getting and Cleaning Data Project.

This repository was built for the course project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course at Coursera. It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset. The goal of this project is to create a tidy data.  (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
. It will complete the following steps to transform the data into something that we are able to glean information out of.
